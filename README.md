# data-science-nanodegree-udacity
This repo contains projects for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project, I have used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I ran SQL queries and 
proposed some interesting questions about the database. The visualizations shows the output of the queries when I transfered the query results to excel. 

The project presentation has 4 slides, each shows:

<ul>
<li>A question of interest.</li>
<li>Has a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.</li>
<li>Has a supporting visualization created using the final data of the SQL query that answers the question of interest.</li>
</ul>
